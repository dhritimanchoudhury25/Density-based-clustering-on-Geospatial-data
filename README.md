# Density-based-clustering-on-Geospatial-data
The purpose of this project was to find out the accurate location of a user based on their coordinates captured during various events. Since GPS is not always reliable for the exact location and has a dependency on the device being used, there were cases wherein the actual location of a user was not in the vicinity of the location that was captured.
